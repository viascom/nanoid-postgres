# Nano ID for PostgreSQL

A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for Postgres.

> ‚ÄúAn amazing level of senseless perfectionism, which is simply impossible not to respect.‚Äù

* **Small.** Just a simple Postgres function.
* **Safe.** It uses pgcrypto random generator. Can be used in clusters.
* **Short IDs.** It uses a larger alphabet than UUID (`A-Za-z0-9_-`). So ID size was reduced from 36 to 21 symbols.
* **Portable**. Nano ID was ported
  to [over 20 programming languages](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/blob/main/README.md#other-programming-languages).

## How to use

```sql
SELECT nanoid(); -- Simplest way to use this function. Creates an id, with the defaults of the created nanoid() function.
SELECT nanoid(4); -- size parameter set to return 4 digit ids only
SELECT nanoid(3, 'abcdefghij'); -- custom size and alphabet parameters defined. nanoid() generates ids concerning them.
SELECT nanoid(10, '23456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 1.85); -- nanoid() could generates ids more performant with a custom defined additional bytes factor.
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable(
    id char(21) DEFAULT nanoid() PRIMARY KEY
);

or

-- To use a custom id size
CREATE TABLE mytable(
    id char(14) DEFAULT nanoid(14) PRIMARY KEY
);

or

-- To use a custom id size and a custom alphabet
CREATE TABLE mytable(
    id char(12) DEFAULT nanoid(12, 'ABC123') PRIMARY KEY
);
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* PostgreSQL 9.4 or newer

Execute the file `nanoid.sql` to create the `nanoid()` function on your defined schema. The nanoid() function will only
be available in the specific database where you run the SQL code provided.

**Manually create the function in each database:** You can connect to each database and create the function. This
function can be created manually or through a script if you have many databases. Remember to manage updates to the
function. If you change the function in one database, those changes will only be reflected in the other databases if you
update each function.

## Adding to the default template database

**Use a template database:** If you often create databases that need to have the same set of functions, you could create
a template database that includes these functions. Then, when you create a new database, you can specify this template,
and PostgreSQL will make the new database a copy of the template.

Here's how to do that:

1. Connect to template1 database:
2. Then, run your nanoid() function creation code.

*If the function is only needed for specific applications, it might be better to create it manually in each database
where needed or create a custom template database that includes this function and use that template when creating new
databases for these applications.*

Also, note that changes to template1 won't affect existing databases, only new ones created after the changes. Existing
databases will need to have the function added manually if required.

## Usage Guide: `nanoid_optimized()`

The `nanoid_optimized()` function is an advanced version of the `nanoid()` function designed for higher performance and
lower memory overhead. While it provides a more efficient mechanism to generate unique identifiers, it assumes that you
know precisely how you want to use it.

üö´ **Warning**: No checks are performed inside `nanoid_optimized()`. Use it only if you're sure about the parameters you'
re passing.

### Function Signature

```sql
nanoid_optimized(
    size int,
    alphabet text,
    mask int,
    step int
) RETURNS text;
```

### Parameters

- `size`: The desired length of the generated string.
- `alphabet`: The set of characters to choose from for generating the string.
- `mask`: The mask used for mapping random bytes to alphabet indices. The value should be `(2^n) - 1`, where `n` is a
  power of 2 less than or equal to the alphabet size.
- `step`: The number of random bytes to generate in each iteration. A larger value might speed up the function but will
  also increase memory usage.

### Example Usage

Generate a NanoId String of length 10 using the default alphabet set:

```sql
SELECT nanoid_optimized(10, '_-0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 63, 16);
```

### Tips:

- **Performance**: This function is optimized for performance, so it's ideal for scenarios where high-speed ID
  generation is needed.
- **Alphabet Set**: The larger your alphabet set, the more unique your generated IDs will be, but also consider the mask
  and step parameters' adjustments.
- **Customization**: Feel free to adjust the parameters to suit your specific needs, but always be cautious about the
  values you're inputting.

By following this guide, you can seamlessly integrate the `nanoid_optimized()` function into your projects and enjoy the
benefits of its optimized performance.
